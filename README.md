# Flipbook-Creator
Using Different JavaScript libraries like pdf.min.js and turn.min.js, I have tried to create a Custom Flipbook.

Image Flipper:
Once the user provides with the images to be used into the Flipper, Using turn.js a Image Flipper is generated.

PDF Flipper:
I am able to render the user's provided pdf, but I am facing issues integrating it to the turn.js library.


I have used CDN Scripts, hence it is advisable to download library folders from their offical websites !!
